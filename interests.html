      <h1>My Interests</h1>

      <p>I have a deep and growing interest in technology and its potential to transform lives. As a future software engineer, I am passionate about learning new programming languages, building practical solutions, and staying updated on the latest developments in software development. I enjoy working on real-world projects that challenge my creativity and help solve everyday problems.</p>

      <p>In addition to tech, I am fascinated by innovation and entrepreneurship. I constantly explore ideas around how technology can be used to improve service delivery in sectors like finance, education, and healthcare. Iâ€™m particularly inspired by how African youth are creating local solutions with global impact, and I strive to be part of this movement.</p>

      <p>Community service is also close to my heart. Having been a beneficiary of the Equity Wings to Fly Scholarship, I deeply understand the value of giving back. I actively support mentorship programs and initiatives that promote digital literacy and empower underprivileged communities, especially in rural areas.</p>

      <p>Personal development is another key interest. I frequently read books, listen to podcasts, and attend workshops that focus on leadership, productivity, and career growth. I believe in lifelong learning and constantly seek ways to become a better version of myself.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy writing code, watching tech videos on YouTube, participating in hackathons, and exploring emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and cybersecurity. I also enjoy photography, creative design, and documenting life through visuals and digital storytelling.</p>
